    Basic Snapshotting
  </h2>
  <div class="block">

    <p>
    Git has an 'staging area' (a.k.a 'cache' or 'index').  This allows you to build up a series
    of well composed snapshots from changed files in your working directory, 
    rather than having to commit all of the file changes at once.
    </p>

    <p class="nutshell">
    <strong>(1) Use <code>git add</code> to start tracking new
    files and also to stage changes to already tracked files. (2) Use
    <code>git status</code> and <code>git diff</code> to see what has been
    modified and staged.  (3) Use <code>git commit</code> to record your
    snapshot into your history.  This '3-stage workflow' is what you use
    most of the time.</strong>

  <div class="block">
    <p>
    You have to add content to the staging area before you 
    can commit it.  Run <code>git add</code> to add new modifications to your staging
    area.
    </p>

    <p>We can use <code>git status</code> to see what the
    state of our project is.
    </p>
    
<pre>
<b>$ git status</b>
</pre>

    <p> Let's make a few things easier on ourselves. (This is a one-time personalization.)</p>
    
    <p> TASK:
      <ol>
      <li>Clone from git://github.com/cczona/git-essentials-extras.git into your home directory.
      <li>Move .bashrc & .gitconfig from the repository into the top level of your home directory.
      <li>Use your text editor to change the settings in ~/.gitconfig to your own name and email address. Save.
      <li>Run <code>$ source ~/.bashrc</code>.  
      </ol>
    </p>    

    <p>Right now we have two untracked files.  Add them.</p>

<pre>
<b>$ git add README hello.py</b>
<b>$ git status</b>
</pre>

    <p class="aside">
    By the way, you can add all files &amp; folders in the current working directory using: <code>git add .</code>
    </p>

    <p>OK, so now if we edit one of these files and run <code>git status</code>
    again, we will see something odd.</p>
<pre>
<b>$ echo "appending this line of text" >> README</b>
<b>$ git status</b>
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   README
#	new file:   hello.py
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   README</pre>

    <p class="nutshell">
    <strong>Run <code>git add</code> to 
    stage changes you've made to it.
    <i>Anything you've changed that is not added will not be included</i></p>
