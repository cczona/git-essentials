  <h2>How to Think Like Git</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>
    How did you do basic version control before
    you used a tool for it?  Chances are that you simply copied your 
    project directory to save what it looked like at that point, maybe putting the
    date in the name of the backup.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is essentially what Git is. You tell Git you want to save a snapshot
    of your project with the <code>git commit</code> command and it basically 
    records a snapshop of what all of the files in your project look like at 
    that point in time.  Then most of the commands work with that series of snapshots to see
    how they differ or pull content out of them, etc.
