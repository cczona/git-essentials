  <h2>How to Think Like Git</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>
    Let's start from scratch.  Assume you are designing a new source 
    code management system.  How did you do basic version control before
    you used a tool for it?  Chances are that you simply copied your 
    project directory to save what it looked like at that point.
    </p>

    <p>
    That way, you can easily revert files that get messed up later, or 
    see what you have changed by comparing what the project looks like
    now to what it looked like when you copied it.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you are really paranoid, you may do this often, maybe putting the
    date in the name of the backup.
    </p>

    <p>
    In that case, you may have a bunch of snapshots of your project that 
    you can compare and inspect from. You can even use this model to 
    fairly effectively share changes with someone.  
    </p>

    <p>
    This is essentially what Git is. You tell Git you want to save a snapshot
    of your project with the <code>git commit</code> command and it basically 
    records a snapshop of what all of the files in your project look like at 
    that point.  Then most of the commands work with that series of snapshots to see
    how they differ or pull content out of them, etc.  
    </p>

    <p>
    If you think about Git
    as a tool for storing and comparing and merging snapshots of your project,
    it may be easier to understand what is going on and how to do things 
    properly.
